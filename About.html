                  </header>
                  <p>
                    The only identity we desire is to be the church that you
                    read about in the Bible, nothing more and nothing less! Our
                    Lord came to this earth to establish His church (<strong
                      >Matthew 16:18</strong
                    >) and we diligently strive to fill our role as “the church
                    of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth”
                    (<strong>1 Timothy 3:15</strong>).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We have no headquarters anywhere in this world. The church
                    is the body of Christ, and He is its only head (<strong
                    >Matthew 28:18; Ephesians 1:22-23</strong
                    >). We have no governing body that determines doctrine or
                    policy for our congregations. Rather, following the pattern
                    laid out in the Bible, each congregation is autonomous,
                    self-governing. We have no creed book, manual or official
                    statement of church doctrine. The Bible is our only
                    authority as to what we believe, teach and practice
                    doctrinally (<strong>2 Timothy 3:15-17</strong>).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our mission is to teach the gospel of Christ throughout the
                    world (<strong>Mark 16:15-16</strong>). Jesus Christ is our
                    only savior, and there is no way to God except through Him
                    (<strong>John 14:6</strong>). All are guilty of sin (<strong
                      >Romans 3:23</strong
                    >). The consequence of sin is spiritual death (<strong
                      >Romans 6:23</strong
                    >). Forgiveness and salvation await all “in Christ” (<strong
                      >Romans 8:1</strong
                    >). The gospel is God’s message of salvation through Christ
                    (<strong>Romans 1:16</strong>).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    God’s plan for man’s salvation is simple and
                    straightforward. It is only by God’s grace through faith
                    that we can be saved (<strong>Ephesians 2:8-9</strong>). As
                    a person responds to God’s offer of grace by repenting of
                    his sin (<strong>Acts 3:19</strong>), confessing his faith
                    in Christ (<strong>Matthew 10:32-33</strong>) and submitting
                    to baptism “into Christ” (<strong>Romans 6:3</strong>), his
                    sins will be cleansed by the blood shed by the Lord on the
                    cross (<strong>Acts 22:16; Hebrews 9:27-28</strong>). He
                    then begins a new life of faithfulness to God (<strong
                      >2 Cor. 5:17; Revelation 2:10</strong
                    >).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our intent is to submit to God’s will, as communicated in
                    His word, in all matters of faith. “The churches of Christ
                    greet you” (<strong>Romans 16:16</strong>).

                    <h3>What we believe</h3>
                  </header>
                  <p>
                    The Seneca church of Christ believes in God as the
                    all-loving, all-powerful creator of the universe (<strong
                      >Genesis 1:1</strong
                    >). We stand by the Bible as God’s inspired revelation for
                    mankind (<strong>2 Timothy 3:16-17</strong>) and use it as
                    our only standard for faith and morality (<strong
                      >2 Peter 1:3</strong
                    >). We also believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God
                    (<strong>John 20:31</strong>), who through His death,
                    burial, and resurrection provides salvation for mankind
                    (<strong>1 Thessalonians 5:9-10</strong>). <br />

                    <br />All people need this salvation because our sins
                    against God’s standard separate us from Him (<strong
                      >Romans 3:23; Isaiah 59:1-2</strong
                    >). Through faith and obedience to the gospel in the name of
                    Jesus we can be forgiven and added to the church, Christ’s
                    body (<strong>Romans 1:16; Acts 2:38, 41</strong>). The
                    church serves as God’s spiritual kingdom and family (<strong
                      >Matthew 16:18-19; 1 Timothy 3:15</strong
                    >), and its members are to build up one another in love
                    (<strong>Ephesians 4:15-16</strong>). Just as Jesus was
                    raised from the dead, those in His church have the hope of
                    eternal life in heaven through resurrection (<strong
                      >John 5:25-29</strong
                    >).<br />

                    <h3>What to expect when you visit us</h3>
                  </header>
                  <p>
                    If you have not worshiped with a church of Christ or with
                    the Seneca church of Christ in particular, here is some
                    information to familiarize you with our Sunday worship
                    service.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our worship is simple, based on the pattern of worship in
                    the New Testament, & focused on expressing our adoration
                    for God, and conforms to His will as communicated in
                    scripture. We meet every first day of the week to
                    commemorate, through the Lord’s Supper, the sacrifice of
                    Christ on the cross for our sins (<strong>Acts 20:7</strong
                    >). We sing praises to God a cappella (<strong
                      >Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16</strong
                    >). We openly study and teach God’s word (<strong
                      >2 Timothy 4:2</strong
                    >). We pray for God’s guidance, wisdom, protection,
                    forgiveness and blessings (<strong
                      >1 Timothy 2:1; James 1:5; 5:13, 16</strong
                    >). We give back to God from the financial blessings with
                    which He has blessed us (<strong
                      >1 Corinthians 16:2; 2 Corinthians 9:6-7</strong
                    >). We would love to meet you,
                    worship God with you, and grow with you in faith.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>THE SERVICE AT A GLANCE</strong> <br />There are no
                    assigned seats. The style is patterned after the examples
                    and teachings of the earliest Christians in the New
                    Testament. The service typically lasts from one hour to an
                    hour and fifteen minutes. If you feel comfortable doing so,
                    please fill out the brief attendance card located on the
                    back of the pew so that we might have the chance to get to
                    know you better.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>WHEN YOU ARRIVE</strong> <br />Bible classes on Sundays
                    begin at 10:00 AM, with classes for children, teens, college
                    students, and adults. Our nursery is ready to receive
                    children from birth through 24 months. Worship begins at
                    11:00 AM and usually ends about 12:15 PM. We have Sunday
                    evening services at 6:00 PM, and Bible classes on Wednesday
                    evenings beginning at 7:00 PM.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>LEADERSHIP OF THE SERVICE</strong><br />
                    Leadership in worship is not limited to those formally
                    recognized as ministers and elders. You will see Christian
                    men from various walks of life taking active roles such as
                    reading scripture, serving communion, and participating in
                    prayers. We are concerned to include all members in our
                    worship in ways that are biblical, orderly, and
                    meaningful.<br />
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>THE SINGING</strong><br />
                    You will notice that our worship in song is without
                    instrumental accompaniment. We believe that a cappella
                    congregational singing both enhances our personal
                    involvement in the worship and conforms to the New Testament
                    example (a cappella literally means “in the manner of the
                    church,” or “as in the chapel”).<br />
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>THE LORD'S SUPPER (COMMUNION)</strong><br />
                    We celebrate the Lord’s Supper every Sunday. Jesus
                    established the practice of sharing the bread and the cup so
                    Christians might weekly remember the sacrifice of his body
                    and blood to make a new covenant with God possible for us.
                    We leave to each person the decision to participate in the
                    Supper.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>THE OFFERING</strong><br />
                    Typically following the Lord’s Supper, we provide an
                    opportunity to make an offering. Occasionally, we will also

                    <strong>THE SERMON</strong><br />The sermon is the time when
                    the “good news” proclaimed and applied to our lives today.
                    We hope you will find it encouraging, relevant and
                    Bible-based. At the close of a sermon, the minister and
                    elders will respond to anyone’s personal needs—a prayer
                    concern, the desire to be baptized, an intention to recommit
                    one’s life to the Lord, or other spiritual needs.
